# Experience 
***
### June 2012 – Aug 2012 Worked an Internship LSIIT (Image Sciences, Computer Sciences and Remote Sensing Laboratory) of the University of Strasbourg, France.
* Develop a Java plug in for the version four of a program called Protégé. The purpose of the plug-in was to add the functionality to Protégé so that it may read individuals from a file in ARFF(Attribute Relation File Format).
* I worked with ontologies and remote sensing algorithms.
